# hello-world

Hello humankind, 

My name is Ryan. I am a grad student at the University of Utah and this is my first time using Github. If you feel like my code is inefficient, well thats because I am not a CS major, bare with me as I try learning new things. If you notice anything that could be done better/more efficiently, or if you notice any mistakes, please reach out and let me know and I would be happy to talk about the task at hand.
